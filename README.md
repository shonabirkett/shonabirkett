## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! My name is Shona and I'm a currently live in Kelowna, Canada. :pushpin:

I have more than three years experience working as a data scientist/full-stack developer in the virtual reality (VR) healthcare market.

I decided to use my coding skills to pursue data science after graduating with an honours bachelor of science degree in Physics. Since then, I have explored both data processing and full-stack development. 

:seedling: Outside of work, I love to read and spend time outdoors. I've recently taken an interest in learning more about nuclear energy and particle physics.
