## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shona, and I'm currently based in Kelowna, Canada. :pushpin:

I have more than three years experience working in the virtual reality (VR) healthcare market as a data scientist and full-stack developer. I decided to pursue data science after graduating with an honours bachelor of science degree in Physics. Since then, I have gained experience in both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy using Python to analyze data and create beatiful visualizations.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to check my GitHub profile. :smiley:
