## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shona, and I'm currently based in Kelowna, Canada. :pushpin:

I have more than three years experience working in the virtual reality (VR) healthcare market as a data scientist and full-stack developer. I decided to pursue data science after graduating with an honours bachelor of science degree in Physics. Since then, I have gained experience in both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy using Python to analyze data and create beatiful visualizations.

#### Here are my technical skills:
* Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
* Python Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Plotly and Matplotlib. 
* Full Stack Development and App Development: Flask, React, Docker and Dash. 
* AWS Services: DynamoDB, Amplify, Cognito, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, S3, AppSync and EC2. 
* Data Science Tools: AWS, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, ArcGIS and Geospatial Analyst. 
* Physics Modelling: Python-based simulations and models.
